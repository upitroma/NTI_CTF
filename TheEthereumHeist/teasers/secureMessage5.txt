Friend,
I've got good news and bad news.

Bad news first:
I can confirm there is no physical location.
So I've wasted 100k on drilling equipment for nothing.

Now for the good news:
There IS a vault, but it dosn't contain cash.
It containes Ethereum, a cryptocurrency.

By my calculations, that vault should contain millions worth of Ethereum.


Also, we may have a problem.
That network map was apparently leaked by another hacker group.
It's only a matter of time before they break into the vault.
We need to move quickly to get there first.

So the new plan:
1. Break in through the entrance nodes.
2. Gain access to The Helping Hand's servers.
3. Escalate your privileges untill you are at or above the admin's clearance level.
4. Find the vault.
5. Get into the vault.
6. Profit.

I'll see about getting access to those entrance vectors,
-NULL
