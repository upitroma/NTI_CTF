Friend,
I've figured out the entrance nodes.

The main entrance is a known login:
Username: guest
Password: guest

The public web server is their main company website.
Maybe you can use it to find some login info.

The entertainment entry point is a simple clicker game.
Maybe you can find a way in by exploiting the game.

Finally, there is the computing sector.
This is where most of the company's computational programs are done.
Maybe you could use that computing power against them.


Also, it looks like they've steped up there security.
All ssh logins must first log into sshaccess.
From there, you can log into other users.

Username: sshaccess
Password: nti-ctf-ethereum

We launch our attack soon,
-NULL
