Friend,
Today is the day.

The server is located at 50.116.25.203.

You should be able to log in as sshaccess:
ssh sshaccess@50.116.25.203
password: nti-ctf-ethereum
Once in, you should be able to switch to guest:
su guest
password: guest 

You might also be able to find a more elevated login by searching their website:
http://50.116.25.203

You should also be able to jump straight to an employee login by exploiting their clicker game:
http://50.116.25.203:4000

If you really want to challenge your skills, you might be able to skip right to the moderator's account by exploiting their computing engine.
http://50.116.25.203:8080

Remember what we learned from the network layout. You can always start with a low privelaged account, and work your way up.
The only real goal is the vault.

Good luck,
