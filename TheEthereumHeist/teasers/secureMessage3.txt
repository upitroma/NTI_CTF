Friend,
I've managed to find what looks like a building layout for The Helping Hand's HQ.

Somethings off about it though...
Nothing makes sense.

Why would the vault be on the fourth floor and not underground?
Why are there those rooms sticking out of the side?
What do those four arrows mean?
Why do most floors have a hole in them?

I'll let you know when I figure out what's going on.
