Friend,
I've figured it out.

That's not a building layout.
It's a network layout.

Each floor is a diffrent user account.
The higher up the user is, the more privelages they have.

Those holes in the floors are most likely escalation vulnerabilities.
It looks like once in, you can gain access to the account directly above you.

Each of the side rooms with the arrows are entrance vectors.
In theory, those vectors could be used to gain access to the their server.


Why would a company make a map like this?

Also, I did more scouting and I can't find any instance of a physical location for The Helping Hand at all.
Maybe there is no vault after all...

I'll keep you updated,
-NULL
