Friend,
I'm so glad to be able to work with someone of your talents.

I have reason to believe that the new and popular, tech based, non-profit cooperation, named "The Helping Hand" is secretly a money laundering coverup.

An illegal company of that size can't store their money in a bank. 
They must be storing their money in some kind of vault.

Our plan, break into that vault.

I'll attach further intel as I recieve it,
